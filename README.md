College Society Website

This is a responsive multi-page website scaffold for a college society.

Pages
- Home: `index.html`

- Event Gallery: `gallery.html`
- Academics: `academics.html`

Editing Content
- Replace placeholder text directly in each HTML page.
- Add images to `assets/images/` and update `<img>` tags when ready.
- For videos, use YouTube embeds or `<video src="assets/videos/yourfile.mp4" controls></video>`.

Styling
- Global styles are in `assets/css/styles.css`.
- Header and footer are white per requirements.

Behavior
- Mobile nav toggle and dynamic year are in `assets/js/main.js`.

Next Steps
